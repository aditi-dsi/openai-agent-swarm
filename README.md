# Build Multi-Agent AI System with OpenAI Swarm using Ollama
OpenAI's Swarm framework offers a groundbreaking approach to orchestrating multiple AI agents. It helps different AI agents work together, like a team, to tackle big tasks. This setup is execellent for various types of tasks, from handling customer questions where one AI might greet the customer while another solves their problem to analyzing big data where one AI collects information, another processes the numbers, and a third turns it all into easy-to-understand charts. The possibilities are endless.
